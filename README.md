# Local Testing

I'm now able to locally test x157.github.io on my Windows workstation thanks to WSL.  It's amazing to have Linux on Windows.  Thanks WSL!

To set it up, follow the steps below.  For additional reading, consider: [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
