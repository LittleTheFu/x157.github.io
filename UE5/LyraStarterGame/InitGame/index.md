# Game Initialization

The GameMode initializes when a World is loaded.
The [World Settings](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#LyraWorldSettings)
defines the [GameMode](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#LyraGameMode) to use
and (in [Lyra](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/))
which [Lyra Experience](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/)
to load by default.

There are different ways a World can come to be loaded,
including clicking the "Play In Editor" (PIE) button.

As discussed in more detail in
[Lyra Experience](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/),
unlike other Games, in Lyra you must ensure to
**delay all game play** until
`OnExperienceLoaded`, perhaps long after `BeginPlay`.


## World Load

### WorldðŸ¡’InitializeActorsForPlay

`LogWorld: Bringing World /XistGame/Maps/L_WorldName.L_WorldName up for play`

#### InitGame

- GameModeðŸ¡’InitGame

#### Initialize Components of ALL World Actors

Initialization of World Actors is in **RANDOM ORDER**.

- GameModeðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
  - GameStateðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
  - GameStateðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
  - GameModeðŸ¡’InitGameState
- GameModeðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents

`LogWorld: Bringing up level for play took: 0.013386`

#### Initialize Player Controller / State

- GameModeðŸ¡’Login
  - GameModeðŸ¡’SpawnPlayerController
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’InitPlayerState
        - PlayerStateðŸ¡’PreInitializeComponents
        - PlayerStateðŸ¡’PostInitializeComponents
          - GameStateðŸ¡’AddPlayerState
        - PlayerController->OnPlayerStateChanged
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’AddCheats
  - GameModeðŸ¡’InitNewPlayer
- PlayerControllerðŸ¡’SetPlayer
  - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’SetupInputComponent
  - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’ReceivedPlayer
    - `CommonGame` adds root HUD layout
- GameModeðŸ¡’OnPostLogin


### World BeginPlay

- All World Subsystems OnWorldBeginPlay
- GameModeðŸ¡’StartPlay
  - GameStateðŸ¡’HandleBeginPlay
    - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’PushInputComponent
    - All World Actors BeginPlay (**RANDOM ORDER**)
      - GameModeðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - GameStateðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - PlayerControllerðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - PlayerStateðŸ¡’BeginPlay
      - ... etc ...


### Lyra Experience Load

In PIE, the World's Default Lyra Experience gets loaded on the tick after GameModeðŸ¡’InitGame.

In Game, the appropriate Lyra Experience is loaded by
the Frontend State Component (or your similar Game State Component).


#### Experience Load Procedure

- Load Experience Asset and its References
- Load all GameFeature Plugin (GFP) dependencies
- Activate GFPs (execute GameFeature Actions)
- Broadcast [`OnExperienceLoaded`](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#OnExperienceLoaded)

[Experience Loading Procedure](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#ExperienceLoadingProcedure)
