# Game Initialization

The GameMode initializes when a World is loaded.
There are different ways a World can come to be loaded,
including clicking the "Play In Editor" (PIE) button.

The World Settings defines the GameMode to use,
and for [Lyra](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/),
which [Lyra Experience](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/) to load.


## World Load

In Game, Frontend State Component (or your similar Game State Component) loads Lyra Experience

For full details, see
[Experience Loading Procedure](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#ExperienceLoadingProcedure)

TLDR version:

- Load Experience Asset & its References
- Load all GameFeature Plugin dependencies
- Activate GFPs (execute GameFeature Actions)
- Broadcast [`OnExperienceLoaded`](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Experience/#OnExperienceLoaded)
