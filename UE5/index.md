# Unreal Engine 5

At the moment I'm mostly focusing on understanding and extending the UE5
[Lyra Starter Game](./LyraStarterGame/).

To understand Lyra, you also need an understanding of these UE5 plugins:

- [Common UI](./CommonUI/) + CommonGame
- Enhanced Input System *(todo)*
- [Gameplay Ability System](./GameplayAbilitySystem/)
- [GameFeature Plugins](./GameFeatures/)


# Unreal Engine Annotations

- [Perforce Version Control Fundamentals](./Annotations/Inside-Unreal/EpicGames-Version-Control-Fundamentals) *(technically optional; essentially required)*


# Engine Tips & Tricks

- [Core Redirects: How to Redirect Blueprints to new/refactored C++](./Engine/Core-Redirects)
- [How to Build (and Use) a Custom Engine](./Engine/)
- [How to Remove "Runtime" name suffix from GameFeature Plugin Code Names](./GameFeatures/How-To-Remove-GameFeature-Runtime-Code-Suffix)


# Windows Tips & Tricks

- [Windows Registry Keys: `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Unreal.ProjectFile`](./Windows-Registry-Keys)
