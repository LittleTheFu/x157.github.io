# Unreal Engine 5

At the moment I'm mostly focusing on understanding and extending the UE5
[Lyra Starter Game](./LyraStarterGame/).

To understand Lyra, you also need an understanding of these UE5 plugins:

- [Common UI](./CommonUI/)
- Enhanced Input System *(todo)*
- [Gameplay Ability System](./GameplayAbilitySystem/)


# Windows Tips & Tricks

- [Windows Registry Keys: `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Unreal.ProjectFile`](./Windows-Registry-Keys)
