# Unreal Engine 5

At the moment I'm mostly focusing on understanding and extending the UE5
[Lyra Starter Game](./LyraStarterGame/).

I'm also documenting some ideas RE [Development in UE5](./Dev/).

To understand Lyra, you also need an understanding of these UE5 plugins:

- [Common UI](/UE5/CommonUI/) + CommonGame
- Enhanced Input System
  - [Official UE 5.1 Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine/)
  - [Epic Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/eD13/unreal-engine-enhanced-input-in-ue5)
- [Gameplay Ability System](/UE5/GameplayAbilitySystem/)
  - Gameplay Attributes and Gameplay Effects ([Epic Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/gameplay-attributes-and-gameplay-effects-for-the-gameplay-ability-system-in-unreal-engine/))
- [GameFeature Plugins](/UE5/GameFeatures/)
- [`ModularGameplay` Plugin](/UE5/ModularGameplay/)
