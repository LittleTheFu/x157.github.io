# Development in UE5

Coming from a traditional Unix systems C++ background and now learning UE5 development,
some things are Windows, some things are GameDev,
some things are just plain new and/or different.

Following are some ideas I hope will help new UE5 C++ devs have an easier time.

[UE5 C++ Debugging Tips](./DebuggingTips):

  - [Build Target: `DebugGame Editor`](./DebuggingTips#BuildTarget_DebugGame_Editor)
  - [C++ Debug Coding Style](./DebuggingTips#CppCodingStyleDebugging)
  - [Xist Log Format](./DebuggingTips#XistLogFormat) -- Logs are helpful and save time

Developer Tools:

- [IDE Options](./IDE) - choosing the right IDE can save you time and money
- [Source Control](./Source-Control)
