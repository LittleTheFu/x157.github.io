# Development in UE5

Coming from a traditional Unix systems C++ background and now learning UE5 development,
some things are Windows, some things are GameDev,
some things are just plain new and/or different.

Following are some ideas I hope will help new UE5 C++ devs have an easier time.

- [UE5 C++ Debugging Tips](./DebuggingTips)
    - [Build Target: `DebugGame Editor`](./DebuggingTips#BuildTarget_DebugGame_Editor)
    - [C++ Debug Coding Style](./DebuggingTips#CppCodingStyleDebugging)

## IDE: Rider, or VS+ReSharper

Personally I prefer to use
[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
rather than Visual Studio as an IDE.  Rider has built-in UE5 integration
that really is a **must-have** for any serious UE5 C++ developer.

If you prefer to use Visual Studio, you should seriously consider purchasing the
[ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/resharper-cpp-unreal-engine/)
plugin for Visual Studio to get UE5 integration similar to Rider.

These tools aren't free, but they aren't prohibitively expensive either.
Given that `time == $`, IMO it's worthwhile to
spend some $ now to save yourself a lot of time later.
Personally I tend to lean toward `time >= $`,
assuming one has the luxury of discretionary spending.

Check for student discounts if applicable, I believe they are sometimes (always?) offered.
