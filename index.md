Welcome to X157 Dev Notes.

At the moment I'm working my way through UE5's Lyra Starter Game, learning both Unreal Engine and Lyra simultaneously.  In an attempt to save fellow simulants some discovery time, I'm hosting some notes here that I hope will be useful.

I'm an expert C++ developer who has mentored developers and team leaders, but I have ZERO experience with game dev or UE5 going into this.  It should be fun.

My primary focus at the moment: [Developing a Game with UE5 LyraStarterGame](./UE5/LyraStarterGame/)
