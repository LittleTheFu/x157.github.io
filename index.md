Welcome to X157 Dev Notes.

For the past few months I've been working my way through UE5's Lyra Starter Game,
learning both Unreal Engine and Lyra simultaneously.

In an attempt to save fellow simulants some discovery time,
I'm hosting some notes here that I hope will be useful.

I'm an expert C++ developer who has mentored developers and team leaders,
but I had ZERO experience with game dev or UE5 going into this.


# UE5 Lyra Starter Game

My primary focus at the moment: [Developing a Game with UE5 LyraStarterGame](./UE5/LyraStarterGame/)

This led me to study these related, relevant [UE5](./UE5/) topics:

- [Common UI](./UE5/CommonUI/) Plugin
- [Gameplay Ability System](./UE5/GameplayAbilitySystem/)
- [Epic Games: Version Control Fundamentals](./UE5/Annotations/Inside-Unreal/EpicGames-Version-Control-Fundamentals) *(Perforce is practically required to work on Binary Game assets in teams)*
